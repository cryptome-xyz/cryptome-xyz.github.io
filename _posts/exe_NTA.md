I’m currently learning the basics of number theory and algebra through "A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra by Victor Shoup", recommended by my supervisor, Ron Steinfeld. To support others learning independently like myself, I’ll be sharing some of my solutions to the exercises from this book. I hope this will spark discussions and mutual learning. If you spot any inaccuracies or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out at Xinyu.Zhang1@monash.edu.
