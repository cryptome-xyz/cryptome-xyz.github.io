In this paper, we construct a revocable and linkable ring signature (RLRS) scheme, which enables a revocation authority to revoke the anonymity of the real signer in linkable ring signature scheme under any circumstances. In other words, the revocability of RLRS is mandatory. The proposed RLRS scheme inherits the desired properties of group signature (anonymity revocation) and linkable ring signature (spontaneous group formation and linkability). In addition, we proved the security of our scheme in the random oracle model. We also provided a revocable ring confidential transaction protocol based on our RLRS scheme, which embedded the revocability in ring confidential transaction protocol.
