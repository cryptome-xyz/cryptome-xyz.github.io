About me
======
My name is Xinyu Zhang, and Iâ€™m in the final year of my PhD at Monash University. My research interests are symmetric key primitives-based post-quantum cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs. 

My journey into cryptography has been quite unconventional. I initially studied electronic commerce during my bachelorâ€™s degree (which, to put it simply, was meant to prepare me to sell things online ðŸ˜…). At that time, I struggled with my university math courses and couldnâ€™t see the relevance of mathematics in my studies. To be honest, before I learn cryptography, I can't see the the point of learning math (how naive I was!). Now, as I work in cryptography, I regret not paying more attention to my math courses during my bachelorâ€™s. Later, I pursued a Master of Information Technology at Monash University, where I took an elective unit, FIT5163: Information and Computer Security, taught by Joseph Liu, who is now my main supervisor. He is one of the best teachers Iâ€™ve ever had, and his approach to teaching cryptography inspired my passion for the subject. This led me to pursue my masterâ€™s thesis with the topic ring siganture under the supervision of Joseph and Ron. Then, with a recommendation letter from Veronika Kuchta (who was a PostDoc at Monash and the lecturer of FIT5124 Advanced topics for security) to Joseph Liu, I was lucky to be accepted as a PhD student under Josephâ€™s supervision. I am sincerely grateful to everyone who has supported me along this journey!
